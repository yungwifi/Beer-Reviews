# Beer Reviews
Beer Reviews is an application that helps beer drinkers keep track of their favorite beers or not so favorite beers. It is also a good way to keep track of the bars you have visited and how you enjoyed your time there. 

# Technologies Used 

JavaScript, CSS, Materialize, HTML, Express, MongoDB, Mongoose, Body-Parser, Method-Override

# Biggest Problems 

The biggest problem I ran into during this project was when routes started getting double and tripple nested. I had a lot of confusion around diving into and array of objects and how to tell the server to look for data that was 3 models deep. Other than that CSS was pretty tricky for me. I used Materialize so most of the styling was easily done due to that but I am still running into problems with my main style sheet overriding Materialize stylings.

# Lessons Learned 
I learned CRUD. I thought I knew CRUD but I barely did. I learned how to set up routes and views that had CRUD functionality on multiple data models.

# Phase 2 
I would continue to style the app to have a great user experience. I would also like to include media queries that would adjust certain items for mobile. Currently I am about 50% responsive and I would like for it to be styled and fully responsible. My intentions are for this app to only be used on mobile. Super reach goals would be able to allow users to create their own profile that is private to them.
